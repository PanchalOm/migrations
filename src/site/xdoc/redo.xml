    <section name="The 'redo' command">
      <p>The redo command is a shortcut which internally executes a down command and up command. As it executes the same number of steps for both down and up operation, the final migration status does not change.<br />
      The redo command is useful for testing undo part of scripts or re-applying recent migration scripts after edit.</p>

      <p>The redo command takes an integer parameter which indicates the number of migrations to redo. No parameter means 1.</p>

      <p>The redo command was added in version 3.3.10.</p>
